Private VIM-Scripts

symfonyViewToggler
------------------

The a-Register is automatically filled with the path, the git-Folder is in.

Also, in normal  mode, this plugin defines the  mappings <leader>st, <leader>se, <leader>ssp und  <leader>ssv, that open
the twig-Template corresponding to the controller action, that contains  the cursor. For the time being just meant to be
used by myself and one  colleague, cause it is poorly implemented and uses the  hard-coded string 'MEDI' for translating
the logical template names into file pathes.
